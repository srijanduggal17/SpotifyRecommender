Hello!

My dataset can be found in 'dataset.csv'
The way I constructed my dataset can be found in 'Dataset Construction.html' or in 'Dataset Construction.ipynb'

The software dependencies required can be found in the file 'environment.yml'
I used conda as a package manager.
Instructions for installing conda can be found here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
Instructions for recreating my environment can be found here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

To reproduce my experiments, run the Analysis.py file with no arguments:
python Analysis.py

The graphs and figures should appear in a folder titled '_output'.
Inside '_output' will be subfolders for Experiments 1-4 and some additional figures.

Thanks!
